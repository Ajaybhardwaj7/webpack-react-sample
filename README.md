# webpack-react-sample
This is a sample app  to understand  webpack using react with hot loading.

Step 1 : Install all node dependenices in package.json. npm install

Step 2 : Run 'npm run build' cmd. This will run webpack and create the bundle file

Step 3 : Run 'npm run start' cmd. This will create the web dev server at the defined port

Now any changes to the main.js file will auto refresh the browser with new changes.

#Ignore dist folder and info.png for the time being. As this can be used to create multiple bundle file. Try once!
